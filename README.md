The MR60BHA1 60GHz radar module applies FMCW detected theory to implement simultaneous personal breathing rate and heart rate detention in high accuracy, providing a fully total private and secure environment, independently from other noisy influences. It is a standard biotic radar system in consumer electronics, healthcare as well as industrial applications.

The unit supports secondary developments and the improvable factors like small size, digital output, inside algorithm, allow it can be applied in a variety of scenarios applications by universal UART communication interface through a development board like Wio Terminal or the XIAO series.
