## Getting Started

## Arduino Library Overview

!!!Tip
    If this is your first time using Arduino, we highly recommend you to refer to [Getting Started with Arduino](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/).

The library code used in this example can be downloaded by clicking the icon below.

<p style=":center"><a href="https://github.com/limengdu/Seeed-Studio-MR60FDA1-Sersor" target="_blank"><div align=center><img width = 300 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/seeed_logo/DOWNLOAD.png" /></div></a></p>

### Function

Before we get started developing a sketch, let's look at the available functions of the library.

- `void recvRadarBytes()` —— This function takes the length of the current frame returned by radar. The frames are stored in an array according to that length.
**Input parameters:** None
**Return value:** None

- `void Situation_judgment(byte inf[])` —— This function is mainly used to resolve the current motion of the detector. The motion situation includes whether there is someone, whether the person's motion is close or far away, whether there is a pattern, etc.. The information will be printed out through the serial port. At the same time, some data content about the features will be output. The larger the value of the features, the greater the magnitude of the human motion, and the user can develop specific functions to be completed according to the magnitude of the motion accordingly.
**Input parameters:** 
    - `byte inf[]` —— Data frames sent by the radar.

    **Return value:** None

- `void Fall_Detection(byte inf[])` —— This function completes the decoding of the fall detection information returned by the radar and prints the results of the radar detection through the serial port. fall detection information includes: the presence or absence of falls, the confidence level of the fall, the location of the fall and the point cloud data. There will be some functionality not yet implemented here and you may not receive this message until the functionality is implemented, please refer to [this document](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/60GHz_mmWave_Sensor_Fall_Detection_Module_Pro-Universal_Protocol.pdf) for the progress of implementation.
**Input parameters:** 
    - `byte inf[]` —— Data frames sent by the radar.

    **Return value:** None

- `void SerialInit()` —— Set the radar serial port baud rate to 115200. If it is a Seeeduino board, set the soft serial port to RX: 2, TX: 3.
**Input parameters:** None
**Return value:** None

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Get_Started_With_Arduino/img/Add_Zip.png"/></div>


## Arduino Example

Now that we have our library installed and we understand the basic functions, let's run some examples for our XIAO BLE to see how it behaves.

### Materials Required

Before completing the following examples, you will need to prepare the following materials.

|              |              |              |

</table>

**Step 2.** In the menu bar in the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE, select **tool**, choose the type of development board you are using, and select the corresponding serial port.

!!!Tip
    If you are using **MacOS**, the serial port name of the device will often start with **/dev/cu.usbmodem xxx**, ending with the name of the device. If you are using **Windows**, the device's serial port name will often begin with **COM**, again ending with the device's name.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/3.png"/></div>

In this example, we will demonstrate how the radar works with our popular product XIAO BLE.


### Demo1 Decode built-in radar algorithm data output human presence information

The radar has a complete set of built-in algorithms that can directly output the human presence information obtained by the radar judgment. This routine will describe how to print out the human presence information detected by the radar directly through the serial port via code.

The code in this example is as follows.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/41.png"/></div>

```c++
//Human_State_Data_Decoding_Example.ino

#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

FallDetection_60GHz radar;

void setup()
{
  radar.SerialInit();
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(1500);
  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
 radar.recvRadarBytes();                       //Receive radar data and start processing
 if (radar.newData == true) {                  //The data is received and transferred to the new list dataMsg[]
    byte dataMsg[radar.dataLen+3] = {0x00};
    dataMsg[0] = 0x53;                         //Add the header frame as the first element of the array
    for (byte n = 0; n < radar.dataLen; n++)dataMsg[n+1] = radar.Msg[n];  //Frame-by-frame transfer
    dataMsg[radar.dataLen+1] = 0x54;
    dataMsg[radar.dataLen+2] = 0x43;
    radar.newData = false;                     //A complete set of data frames is saved
    
    //radar.ShowData(dataMsg);                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
    radar.Situation_judgment(dataMsg);         //Use radar built-in algorithm to output human motion status
  }
  
}
```

In the `setup()` code, we turn on the **Serial port** and the **Serial1 port** on the XIAO BLE. Serial is used for data printing and Serial1 is used for communication between the XIAO BLE and the radar. According to the baud rate of the radar, we set the baud rate of both serial ports to 115200. When it is ready, the serial monitor will print **Ready**.

```c
adar.recvRadarBytes();
 if (radar.newData == true) {
    byte dataMsg[radar.dataLen+3] = {0x00};
    dataMsg[0] = 0x53;
    for (byte n = 0; n < radar.dataLen; n++)dataMsg[n+1] = radar.Msg[n];
    dataMsg[radar.dataLen+1] = 0x54;
    dataMsg[radar.dataLen+2] = 0x43;
    radar.newData = false;
}
```

In the loop, we first use the `recvRadarBytes()` function to store the data sent by the radar in a fixed-length array `Msg[12]`. Due to the complexity of radar data, a single fixed-length array is not sufficient for our data processing task, so we need an array that can be resized to store the set of data according to the current data frame length. This is where the array `dataMsg[dataLen]` comes into play, seeing that `dataLen` is the actual length of the current data frame. As you can see, we are adding frames to the array of dataMsg here, which is adding the first and last frames to it.

```c
radar.Situation_judgment(dataMsg);
```

When the dataMsg list is completely obtained, it will be used as the parameter of the `Situation_judgment()` function to complete the output of human presence information, and the output result will be printed directly on the serial monitor.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/43.png"/></div>    

!!!Tip
    If you want to see what data is returned by radar, you can uncomment `radar.ShowData(dataMsg);`, which will output the complete set of received data frames through the serial monitor.


### Demo 2 Get radar-reported falls information

Obtaining information on the detection of a person's fall is a special feature of this radar. We can complete the output of detection data by the following code example.

The code in this example is as follows.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/42.png"/></div>

```c++
//Falling_Data_Decoding.ino

#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

FallDetection_60GHz radar;

void setup()
{
  radar.SerialInit();
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(1500);
  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
 radar.recvRadarBytes();                       //Receive radar data and start processing
 if (radar.newData == true) {                  //The data is received and transferred to the new list dataMsg[]
    byte dataMsg[radar.dataLen+3] = {0x00};
    dataMsg[0] = 0x53;                         //Add the header frame as the first element of the array
    for (byte n = 0; n < radar.dataLen; n++)dataMsg[n+1] = radar.Msg[n];  //Frame-by-frame transfer
    dataMsg[radar.dataLen+1] = 0x54;
    dataMsg[radar.dataLen+2] = 0x43;
    radar.newData = false;                     //A complete set of data frames is saved
    
    //radar.ShowData(dataMsg);                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
    radar.Fall_Detection(dataMsg);         //Use radar built-in algorithm to output human motion status
  }
  
}
```

```c
radar.Fall_Detection(dataMsg);
```

When the dataMsg list is completely obtained, it will be used as the parameter of the `Fall_Detection(dataMsg);` function to complete the output of falling data, and the output result will be printed directly on the serial monitor.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/44.png"/></div>

!!!Tip
    If you want to see what data is returned by radar, you can uncomment `radar.ShowData(dataMsg);`, which will output the complete set of received data frames through the serial monitor.


### Demo 3 Sending data to radar

Radar opens a very large number of interfaces for us to get information and to set the radar working mode, etc. This routine will instruct the user how to use the user manual to send data messages to the radar to adjust the parameters of the radar or to obtain the desired data information.

**Step 1.** Obtain data frames based on the desired query.

Download the [Universal Protocol](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/60GHz_mmWave_Sensor_Fall_Detection_Module_Pro-Universal_Protocol.pdf) in the Resource area, and in the table, find the content of the frames you need to query or set up, and organize them.

In this example, suppose you want to query the radar for heartbeat packet data, then you first need to find the frame corresponding to the table.

<div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/45.png"/></div>

The query form shows that to get the data of the heartbeat packet, the data frame to be sent to the radar is:
```
0x53 0x59 0x01 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x0f $<sum> 0x54 0x43
```

The environment variable `$<sum>` refers to the checksum field, how to get it we will introduce in the **step 2.**.

**Step 2.** Get the checksum field.
The checksum field is calculated as follows:

**Frame headers + Control charaters + Command words + Length marking + Data, then take the lower eight bits and convert to hexadecimal numbers**.

For example, in **step 1.**, the frame we want to send is:
```
0x53 0x59 0x01 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x0f $<sum> 0x54 0x43
```

So, 
```
Frame headers + Control charaters + Command words + Length marking + Data =
0x53 + 0x59 + 0x01 + 0x01 + 0x00 + 0x01 + 0x0f = 
0xBE =
0000 0000 1011 1110 (Binary)
```

Then take the lower eight digits of it.
```
1011 1110 (Binary) = 
0xBE
```

So the check sum field in the frame we should send to the radar is 0xBE.

**Step 3.** Send data frames to the radar.

Connect the radar directly to the computer's usb port via a [**UART to USB** device](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-To-Uart-5V-p-1833.html?queryID=588a892811a774ad3005ea0d31427532&objectID=1111&indexName=bazaar_retailer_products). The wiring is shown in the table below.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <td colspan="4"><div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/uart.png"/></div></td></td>
	</tr >
	<tr >

	</tr>
  <tr>
	    <td align="center">TX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">RX</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Use a software like serial debugging assistant to select the serial port where the radar is located.

<div align=center><img width = 200 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/37.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    60GHz radar needs 5V power supply, otherwise the radar may not work properly.

After a successful connection, you will see the radar sending a steady stream of messages.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/39.png"/></div>

Paste the complete data frame we obtained in **step 2.** onto the send area of the software. Then click Send.

```
0x53 0x59 0x01 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x0f 0xBE 0x54 0x43
```

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/40.png"/></div>

You can look out for a set of data returned. This set of data is the information obtained after the query. If you send data that adjusts the parameters of the radar, it will also return such information.

<div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/46.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    If you choose **ASCII** as the format for sending data, each data set needs to be prefixed with **0x**. If you choose **HEX**, then each set of data does not need to be prefixed with **0x**.


## Troubleshooting

### FAQ1: How to apply the code to Seeeduino (or Arduino)?

> Because of the different hardware design, the serial port of XIAO series or Wio Terminal are named Serial1, while Seeeduino or Arduino need to use soft serial port. If you want to use the radar for Seeeduino, you can change the soft serial port or use pins 2 (RX) and 3 (TX).
> <div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/19.png"/></div>

### FAQ2: What should I do if XIAO BLE and Radar collect data for a long time and cannot upload the code?

> At this time, you can use your finger to lightly press the reset button on top of XIAO BLE to re-upload the program to run.

### FAQ3: Why can't I receive the content on certain forms.

> Some of the features we are working on are in intensive development.
