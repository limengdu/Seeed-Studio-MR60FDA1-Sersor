</table>

In addition to the serial software mentioned above, you can also use the [upper computer software](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/Fall_detection_radar.zip) designed for radar directly.

The following two sections explain the role of each part of the software.

<div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/10.png"/></div>

- **Working Area**

    All functions of the upper computer are displayed in the work area only. The main content of the display is concentrated at the top of the workspace.

    **Station:** Shows whether someone is present, moving or stationary.

    **Fall state:** The state of the fall will be presented as an animation of the character. The state in the picture is no fall, and if someone falls, an animated picture of a person falling will be displayed.

    **Settings:** Used to set the port number where the sensor is connected to the PC. Generally, when the sensor is connected to the computer via UART to USB, you need to click **Refresh** button to refresh the port, then select the newly appeared port number, then click **Open** button, and finally click **Start** button to enable the monitoring function.

    **Installing height/cm:** Refers to the installation height. To ensure the accuracy of fall detection, please install the sensor accurately as follows. Please install it on top! The radar should be installed vertically with a horizontal deviation angle of ≤5° to ensure that the radar main beam covers the detection area; the radar installation height is recommended to be 2m≤H≤3m. No obvious obstructions and coverings in front of the radar. Affected by the radar installation height and radar beam range, the maximum radius of moving human detection in this installation mode is R3 ≈ 3 meters; the maximum radius of stationary human detection is R2 ≈ 2.25 meters; the radius of fall detection is R1 ≤ 2 meters.

    For example, if my installation height is 2.6 meters, then I should fill in 260 and click the **Send** button.

- **Invalid Area**

    This area will not work at the moment, but only as a reserved interface.

!!!Attention
    This radar does not currently support range, speed, or point clouds!

## Sensor development with Arduino

### Arduino Library Overview

!!!Tip
    If this is your first time using Arduino, we highly recommend you to refer to [Getting Started with Arduino](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/).

The library code used in this example can be downloaded by clicking the icon below.

<p style=":center"><a href="https://github.com/limengdu/Seeed-Studio-MR60FDA1-Sersor" target="_blank"><div align=center><img width = 300 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/seeed_logo/DOWNLOAD.png" /></div></a></p>

### Function

Before we get started developing a sketch, let's look at the available functions of the library.

- `void recvRadarBytes()` —— This function collects the data frames reported by the Sensor via the UART according to the frame headers and frame tails in the Sensor data protocol. Used in conjunction with the `showData()` function, the collected data information can be printed out via the serial port.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

- `void showData()` —— This function serves to print out the complete data frame reported by the Sensor at once via the serial port and needs to be used in conjunction with the `recvRadarBytes()` function.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

- `void HumanExis_Func()` —— This function is responsible for parsing the data frames of the Sensor and outputting the relevant data on the state of the human presence.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:**

    - `unsigned int sensor_report` —— The value returned indicates which status class the parsed data frame belongs to. The specific categories can be found in the **Default Variables** section. Human movement information is reported only when changes occur.

    - `int bodysign_val` —— The value returned represents the value of the Human Movement Parameter. This value is reported once per second.

- `void Fall_Detection()` —— This function is used to parse and return the detection of a fall. The detection is stored in the variable sensor_report.

    - **Input parameters:** None

    - **Return value:** - `unsigned int sensor_report` —— The value returned indicates which status class the parsed data frame belongs to. The specific categories can be found in the **Default Variables** section. Fall information is reported only when changes occur.

- `void send_func(const unsigned char* buff, int len, bool cyclic /*=false*/)` —— The function is used for sending query frames and command frames.

  - **Input parameters:** 

    - `buff` —— The data frame you want to send to the Sensor.

    - `len` —— The length of the data frame you want to send to the Sensor.

    - `cyclic` —— Cyclic send switch. The default is false, which can be set to **true** if you wish to send this data frame cyclically.

  - **Return value:** None

- `void reset_func()` —— The function serves to reset the Sensor.

  - **Input parameters:** None

  - **Return value:** None

Since you have downloaded the zip Library, open your Arduino IDE, click on **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library**. Choose the zip file you just downloaded，and if the library install correct, you will see **Library added to your libraries** in the notice window. Which means the library is installed successfully.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Get_Started_With_Arduino/img/Add_Zip.png"/></div>


## Arduino Example

Now that we have our library installed and we understand the basic functions, let's run some examples for our XIAO BLE to see how it behaves.

### Materials Required

Before completing the following examples, you will need to prepare the following materials.

	</tr>
</table>

**Step 2.** In the menu bar in the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE, select **tool**, choose the type of development board you are using, and select the corresponding serial port.

!!!Tip
    If you are using **MacOS**, the serial port name of the device will often start with **/dev/cu.usbmodem xxx**, ending with the name of the device. If you are using **Windows**, the device's serial port name will often begin with **COM**, again ending with the device's name.

<div align=center><img width = 700 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/3.png"/></div>

In this example, we will demonstrate how the radar works with our popular product XIAO BLE.


### Demo1 Raw data export

This example will guide you through the process of printing out the raw data reported by the Sensor via the serial port.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60FDA1_print_rawdata**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

In this program, we are using the XIAO nRF52840's hardware **Serial1** port to connect to the Sensor and use the hardware **Serial** port Serial to output data, so we need to initialise this serial port separately in the initialisation function `Setup()`.

In the main `loop()` function we use the function `recvRadarBytes()` to receive data frames from the Sensor and then use the `showData()` function to print out the received data frames via the serial port.

In this program, it is important to note that there is an interval between the reception and output of every two data frames to avoid a jam on the main board. This time should be no less than **150ms**. 

This means that there is no way for the main board to receive all the data frames reported by the Sensor, but as the number of frames reported by the Sensor is very large and frequent, this does not affect the accuracy of using the Sensor to determine the environment.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/7.png"/></div>

### Demo2: Use of human presence detection function

In this example, we will explain how to use the function of human presence detection and print out all the values of this function in the function through the serial monitor.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60FDA1_human_existence_inf_output**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.HumanExis_Func();           //Human existence information output
  if(radar.sensor_report != 0x00){
    switch(radar.sensor_report){
      case NOONE:
        Serial.println("Nobody here.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case SOMEONE:
        Serial.println("Someone is here.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case NONEPSE:
        Serial.println("No human activity messages.");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case STATION:
        Serial.println("Someone stop");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case MOVE:
        Serial.println("Someone moving");
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
      case BODYVAL:
        Serial.print("The parameters of human body signs are: ");
        Serial.println(radar.bodysign_val, DEC);
        Serial.println("----------------------------");
        break;
    }
  }
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

In this example, the function to detect the presence of a human body is implemented by the `HumanExis_Func()` function. The basic logic of the program implementation is that the `HumanExis_Func()` function assigns the status information reported by the sensor to the `sensor_report` variable. Based on the value of `sensor_report`, we then print out all the values in that state through the serial port.

Note that the `sensor_report` corresponds to the data output from the serial port under indentation. For example, the `bodysign_val` variable representing the sign parameter is only valid when `sensor_report` is `BODYVAL`, and is not present in other `sensor_reports` reported by the sensor.

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

### Demo3: Detection of human falls.

In this example, we will use the `Fall_Detection()` function to detect the human falls.

!!!Tip
    The principle of state output for falls is that there is content output only when the sensor detects a change in the state of the fall.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60FDA1_Fall_detection**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.Fall_Detection();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  if(radar.sensor_report != 0x00){
    switch(radar.sensor_report){
        case NOFALL:
            Serial.println("The sensor detects this movement is not a fall.");
            Serial.println("----------------------------");
            break;
        case FALL:
            Serial.println("The sensor detects a fall.");
            Serial.println("----------------------------");
            break;
        case NORESIDENT:
            Serial.println("The sensors did not detect anyone staying in place.");
            Serial.println("----------------------------");
            break;
        case RESIDENCY:
            Serial.println("The sensor detects someone staying in place.");
            Serial.println("----------------------------");
            break;
    }
  }
  delay(200); //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

Among the fall detection functions, there is also a function for dwell detection. The main function of this function is to assist the user or the sensor to determine whether the human body has fallen or not. When there is no human activity for a period of time after a dramatic change in acceleration in the vertical direction (i.e., staying in place), there is a high probability that the sensor will determine that someone has fallen and is unconscious.

### Demo4: Send data to Sensor

Based on the details provided in the user manual, the user can send command frames to the sensor to query or set certain states or modes of the sensor according to the actual needs.

The .ino file named **MR60FDA1_Send_frame** in the examples folder of the sensor library shows us how to send a program that queries the device ID to the sensor.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&Serial1);

const unsigned char DevID_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x02, 0xA1, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0F, 0x5F, 0x54, 0x43};

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.send_func(DevID_buff, 10, false);
  delay(50);                       //Do not set the delay time too long, as this may affect the reception of the data frames returned by the radar.
}
```

In the program of this example, you can see that an array `DevID_buff[10]` is defined, which stores the hexadecimal number of your query device ID, one location per byte.

And the sending is done by `send_func()`. The parameters passed in are the array of frames to be sent, the length of the array, and whether to send in a loop.

If you need to send your own command frames, then you need to define the correct array according to the frame format provided in the user manual.

!!!Tip
    **Regarding the calculation of the check digit "sum".**
    All data frames have a checksum bit to ensure that the data is sent or received accurately. The checksum bit is usually in the penultimate bit of the data frame. It is calculated by adding up all the bits preceding the check bit and taking the lower two bits in hexadecimal.
    Let's take the example of a data frame that queries the device ID.
    <div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Radar_MR24HPCB1/6.png"/></div>
    It can be seen that the checksum bit is in the penultimate bit of the entire data frame. Then we start by adding all the previous hexadecimal numbers.

    `0x53 + 0x59 + 0x02 + 0xA2 + 0x00 + 0x01 + 0x0F = 0x015F`

    Then we need to take the lower two digits of it, which would be **5F**, so the checksum of this data frame is **5F**. If we want to look up the ID of the Sensor, then you can define the following array.

    `const unsigned char DevID_buff[10] = {0x53, 0x59, 0x02, 0xA1, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0F, 0x5F, 0x54, 0x43};`

Upload program. Opening your serial monitor to a baud rate of 115200 should show the result. The output should look something like the below image.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/new_img/9.png"/></div>

At this point please check the data frames returned and if they match the data frames returned as described in the user manual.

Normally, our commands do not need to be repeated to the Sensor, but as the Sensor replies with messages so fast that we cannot be sure that we will receive the exact data message returned by the Sensor. There are two solutions to this problem.
- Re-upload the above procedure several times.
- Set the third parameter of the `send_func()` function (cyclic sending) to `true`. Please note, however, that repeatedly sending data frames of the setting type **may cause the Sensor to jam**, so please use this function with caution. If the Sensor is stuck, disconnect the 5V supply pin from the Sensor and wait a few moments for the function to resume.

### Demo5: Reset Sensor

There may be times when you have problems with your Sensor detecting anomalies or when you want to clear all settings on your Sensor, then you can reset your Sensor according to this example.

The following example program is in the examples folder of the library called **MR60FDA1_Reset_sensor**.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

//#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
//#define RX_Pin A2
//#define TX_Pin A3

//SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
//FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);

// can also try hardware serial with
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&Serial1);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  //  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");

  radar.reset_func();
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
```

Resetting the Sensor is very simple, you just need to call `reset_func()`. The reset only needs to be **executed once**, so we use it in the `Setup()` function.

### Demo6: Using Arduino/Seeeduino

Our library is Arduino compatible and you can also choose the Arduino you have on hand to develop your Sensor project.

The MR60FDA1 Sensor communicates using the UART serial port, you just need to connect the Sensor to your Arduino as wired below.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">MR60FDA1 Sensor</td>
	    <td align="center"></td>
        <td align="center">MCU</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">5V</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">5V</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">GND</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">GND</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td align="center">RX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">soft serial port TX</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td align="center">TX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">soft serial port RX</td>
	</tr>
</table>

All the functions are applied in the same way as in Demo1 to Demo5 above, so we will not repeat them in this example. In this example, we will give you an overview of how to use the Arduino's soft serial port to get data information from the Sensor.

!!!Tip
    For notes on the Arduino soft serial port, please refer to the [official Arduino documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial).

To avoid data confusion caused by using Serial for both output and data transmission, on the Arduino side we usually use a soft serial port.

The import of the soft serial port library and the definition of the RX and TX pins need to be done earlier in the program. The following program defines the **A2** and **A3** pins as the **RX** and **TX** pins of the soft serial port.

```c++
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
//Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
#define RX_Pin A2
#define TX_Pin A3

SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

//we'll be using software serial
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);
```

Also, don't forget to set the baud rate for the soft serial port in the `Setup()` function.

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}
```

Using **Demo1** as an example, if you want to use the Arduino to print the reported data frames from the Sensor, then the complete program is as follows.

```c++
#include "Arduino.h"
#include <60ghzfalldetection.h>

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
// Choose any two pins that can be used with SoftwareSerial to RX & TX
#define RX_Pin A2
#define TX_Pin A3

SoftwareSerial mySerial = SoftwareSerial(RX_Pin, TX_Pin);

// we'll be using software serial
FallDetection_60GHz radar = FallDetection_60GHz(&mySerial);

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200);

  mySerial.begin(115200);

  while(!Serial);   //When the serial port is opened, the program starts to execute.

  Serial.println("Readly");
}

void loop()
{
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  radar.recvRadarBytes();           //Receive radar data and start processing
  radar.showData();                 //Serial port prints a set of received data frames
  delay(200);                       //Add time delay to avoid program jam
}
```

### Demo7: Direct connection to PC for data

You can refer to this routine if you want to use an upper computer designed for Sensor, or if you want to use the serial software to get a complete data frame.

Connect the Sensor directly to the computer's usb port via a **UART to USB** device. The wiring is shown in the table below.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <td colspan="4"><div align=center><img width = 800 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/uart.png"/></div></td></td>
	</tr >
	<tr >
	    <td align="center">UART to USB</td>
	    <td align="center"></td>
        <td align="center">MR60FDA1 Sensor</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">5V</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">5V</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="center">GND</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">GND</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td align="center">RX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">TX</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td align="center">TX</td>
	    <td align="center">--></td>
        <td align="center">RX</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Use a software like serial debugging assistant to select the serial port where the Sensor is located.

<div align=center><img width = 200 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/37.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    MR60FDA1 Sensor needs 5V power supply, otherwise the Sensor may not work properly.

After a successful connection, you will see the Sensor sending a steady stream of messages.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/39.png"/></div>

At the same time, you can also send data frames to the Sensor via the software's send function.

<div align=center><img width = 600 src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/60GHzradar/40.png"/></div>

!!!Attention
    If you choose **ASCII** as the format for sending data, each data set needs to be prefixed with **0x**. If you choose **HEX**, then each set of data does not need to be prefixed with **0x**.

## Troubleshooting

### FAQ1: Can this Sensor detect more than one person at a time in the same environment?

> A: Not available. This Sensor can only be used on a single living object. If more than one person or animal is in the monitoring range, this will have an effect on the results of the monitoring.

### FAQ2: Why can't I see anything in the serial monitor with the XIAO ESP32C3?

> XIAO ESP32C3 serial port function is not quite consistent with the general Arduino hardware, and using Serial1 directly may cause the USB serial port not to work. For related application cases, please go to the [Serial chapter of XIAO ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Pin_Multiplexing/#serial) for details.
