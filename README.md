60GHz mmWave Radar Sensor - Fall Detection Module Pro applies FMCW detected theory to implement simultaneous human activities detection including moving, falling, and stationary in high accuracy, providing a fully total private and secure environment, independently from other noisy influences. It is a standard biotic radar system in private property surveillance, falling caution, elderly health care, performing well in home, hotel, as well as hospital.

The unit supports secondary developments and the improvable factors like small size, digital output, inside algorithm, allow it can be applied in a variety of scenarios applications by universal UART communication interface through a development board like Wio Terminal or the XIAO series.
